md5 collision probability 4.3*10 -60


Assignment:
Day 3:
- Given a text txt[0..n-1] and a pattern pat[0..m-1], write a function search(char pat[], char txt[]) that prints all occurrences of pat[] in txt[]. You may assume that n > m.
  - solve using normal method and "Rabin-Karp" and notice the speed difference using large inputs.
- Given two arrays A[] and B[] of length N, the task is to find the minimum number of operations in which the array A can be converted into array B where each operation consists of adding an integer K into a subarray from L to R.






Day 2:
1. Subset sum problem is to find subset of elements that are selected from a given set whose sum adds up to a given number K. We are considering the set contains non-negative values. It is assumed that the input set is unique (no duplicates are presented).
Inputs:
weights = {15, 22, 14, 26, 32, 9, 16, 8}; target = 53;

2. Generating n bit Gray Codes
Given a number n, the task is to generate n bit Gray codes (generate bit patterns from 0 to 2^n-1 such that successive patterns differ by one bit)
Examples:
Input : 2 
Output : 0 1 3 2
Explanation : 
00 - 0
01 - 1
11 - 3
10 - 2

Input : 3 
Output : 0 1 3 2 6 7 5 4


Day 1:
- Optimize the isEmpty method
- bring support to multi-digit numbers for the compiler
- get int values of variables from memory

- postfix to Infix conversion
- infix to prefix
- return the item ids instead of values in knapsack
