Assignment:
Day 3:
- Given a text txt[0..n-1] and a pattern pat[0..m-1], write a function search(char pat[], char txt[]) that prints all occurrences of pat[] in txt[]. You may assume that n > m.
  - solve using normal method and "Rabin-Karp" and notice the speed difference using large inputs.

- Given two arrays A[] and B[] of length N, the task is to find the minimum number of operations in which the array A can be converted into array B where each operation consists of adding an integer K into a subarray from L to R.
Examples:
  A[] = {3, 7, 1, 4, 1, 2}, B[] = {3, 7, 3, 6, 3, 2}
  Explanation:
  In the above given example only one operation is required to convert from A to B: L = 3, R = 5 and K = 2
  Array after the following operation:
  Index 0: A[0] = 3, B[0] = 3
  Index 1: A[1] = 7, B[1] = 7
  Index 2: A[2] = 1 + 2 = 3, B[2] = 3
  Index 3: A[3] = 4 + 2 = 6, B[3] = 6
  Index 4: A[4] = 1 + 2 = 3, B[4] = 3
  Index 5: A[5] = 2, B[5] = 2
  Input: A[] = {1, 1, 1, 1, 1}, B[] = {1, 2, 1, 3, 1}
  Output: 2
  Explanation:
  In the above given example only one operation is required to convert from A to B â€“
  Operation 1: Add 1 to L = 2 to R = 2
  Operation 2: Add 2 to L = 4 to R = 4






Day 2:
1. Subset sum problem is to find subset of elements that are selected from a given set whose sum adds up to a given number K. We are considering the set contains non-negative values. It is assumed that the input set is unique (no duplicates are presented).
Inputs:
weights = {15, 22, 14, 26, 32, 9, 16, 8}; target = 53;

2. Generating n bit Gray Codes
Given a number n, the task is to generate n bit Gray codes (generate bit patterns from 0 to 2^n-1 such that successive patterns differ by one bit)
Examples:
Input : 2 
Output : 0 1 3 2
Explanation : 
00 - 0
01 - 1
11 - 3
10 - 2

Input : 3 
Output : 0 1 3 2 6 7 5 4


Day 1:
- Optimize the isEmpty method
- bring support to multi-digit numbers for the compiler
- get int values of variables from memory

- postfix to Infix conversion
- infix to prefix
- return the item ids instead of values in knapsack
