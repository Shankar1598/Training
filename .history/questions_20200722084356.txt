1. Rahul, a student pursuing Compiler Design and Architecture decides to build a compiler that performs arithmetic operations. But the one he builds turns out to perform 3 million operations per second for smaller expressions with 2 to 4 operands. But slows down below 1 million operations per second for more complex expression where the number of operands exceeds 7 which is unacceptable for him. How can you help Rahul optimize his compiler to efficiently process expressions?

2. A logistics company uses planes to carry and transport high priority goods. The company uses a Boeing 737-800 which has a takeoff weight of 81 tons which includes the weight of the plane itself which is about 41 tons and the fuel it needs for the flight which is 18 tons. The company wants to make sure they only prioritize high-value deliveries through the air to maximize the profit. Find what is the maximum value of goods they can transport through that plane?

Input:
wt - weight of the items measured in tons
val - value of the items measured in x*10000 USD
items = [
  {'id': 'a', 'val': 5, 'wt': 3},
  {'id': 'b', 'val': 10, 'wt': 9},
  {'id': 'c', 'val': 15, 'wt': 4},
  {'id': 'd', 'val': 2, 'wt': 6},
  {'id': 'e', 'val': 7, 'wt': 4}
]
